          present intention of selling, granting any participation in, or
          otherwise distributing the same, (ii) you understand that such

          Securities Act of 1933, as amended (collectively with the rules and

          a specific exemption from the registration provisions of the

          required to confirm the foregoing pursuant to 506(b) of the Securities
          Act. You hereby agree, represent, warrant and covenant that you will

          shall be effective against us unless made in writing, and no such
          waiver shall be construed as a waiver in any other or subsequent

          Supplemental Terms and Conditions is determined by a court of
          competent jurisdiction or the arbitrators, as applicable, to be
          unenforceable for any reason whatsoever, that term or provision shall
          be modified only to the extent necessary to be enforced, such term or
          provision shall be enforced to the maximum extent permitted by law,
          and the validity of the remainder of these Supplemental Terms and
          Conditions shall not be adversely affected thereby.
